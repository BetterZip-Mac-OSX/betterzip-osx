## What is BetterZip?  

**BetterZip** is a refined archive utility built for users who work with multiple compressed file formats daily. It simplifies how you view, organize, and protect your archives — without needing to extract them first.  

The application opens ZIP, RAR, 7z, TAR, ISO, and dozens of other formats directly, letting you inspect content instantly. You can preview text documents, images, or code files before extracting, making it ideal for developers, designers, and IT professionals handling complex or encrypted archives.  

BetterZip also provides complete control over compression workflows. You can create new archives, edit existing ones, or add password protection with **AES-256 encryption**. Saved presets accelerate repetitive tasks, while integration with **Finder**, **AppleScript**, and **Automator** streamlines archive management into a smooth, one-click experience.  

Built for macOS, BetterZip supports **dark mode**, **Apple Silicon**, and advanced automation. Whether cleaning downloads, sharing large projects, or securing backups, it delivers professional-grade results with an intuitive interface.
